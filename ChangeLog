exact-real Change Log
=====================

.. current developments

v1.3.2
====================

**Fixed:**

* Adapted to changes in cppyythonizations and in the stable release of e-antic. (This changes the serialization format slightly which we do not consider stable yet anyway.)
* Do not check for gmpxxll in configure. We ship a version for compilation and do not need it at runtime.
* in the SageMath interface, an element that is directly initialized with a zero element from libintervalxt does now remember its containing module.



v1.3.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* deserialization of modules over number fields; shared pointers to renf_class was not compared correctly which lead to a module not being identical to a deserialization of a serialization of itself; part of #106.
* some minor C++ coding style such as nullopt instead of {}



v1.3.0
====================

**Changed:**

* compressed output of coefficients in serialization, used to be '{coefficients:[{value0:...}, {value0:...}]}', now that extra layer of "value0" is gone.



v1.2.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* deserialization of multiple elements at the same time; there was a bug that
  only the first element managed to deserialize its containing module.



v1.2.0
====================

**Added:**

* Element::simplify() to drop unnecessary generators

**Changed:**

* improved Module::promote(); should be much faster now and also works when the argument is not a supermodule
* speed up Python interface by simplifying for multiplications & divisions



v1.1.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* trivial bug in compositum computation



v1.1.0
====================

**Added:**

* safety checks to rever deploy script

**Fixed:**

* adapted to changes in e-antic upstream, namely `renf_elem_class::parent()` is
  now never a null pointer since the special handling of rational numbers has
  been dropped upstream.



v1.0.2
====================

**Fixed:**

* operator ** for SageMath wrapper



v1.0.1
====================

**Changed:**

* release new versions with rever

**Fixed:**

* expected output in pyexactreal tests due to changed printing in pyeantic
