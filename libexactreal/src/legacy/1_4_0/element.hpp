// Provide backwards compatible implements of Element::coefficients,
// Element::operator*= and Element::operator/= as defined in the 1.4.0 release.
// In the 2.2.0 release we had to remove mpz_class and mpq_class from the
// template arguments of all methods in the public API of libexactreal since
// otherwise clang deos not export these symbols when building with
// -fvisibility=hidden.
// Therefore, we split coefficients() into coefficinets() and
// rationalCoefficients(), and added specializations of operator*= and
// operator/=. However, we can not instantiate the old versions of the
// templated versions due to
// http://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_active.html#1665, i.e., we would
// break ABI compatibility with this change.
// We now implement the old ABI in a separate translation unit. The underlying
// implementation is still in the original element.cc, implementing the
// functions below.
